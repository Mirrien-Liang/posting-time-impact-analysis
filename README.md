## Set up environment
Make sure you have Python 3.12.0.

Install all dependencies by running the following command in terminal:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Entry Point
The main executable is:
```bash
python main.py
```

## Results
Progress are updated in the console directly. Intermediate plots are stored in `./figures` with meaningful names (see interpretation in the report).

## Jupyter Notebook
As a backup, a notebook at `./notebooks/data_cleaning.ipynb` showed the analysis in a breakdown fashion.
